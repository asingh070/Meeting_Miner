John: Hey team, thanks for joining. Let's discuss the Q4 roadmap.
Sarah: Sure, I think we should prioritize the mobile app launch.
Mike: Haan yaar, dekh lenge. But we need to make sure the backend API is ready first.
John: That's a good point. Sarah, can you check with the API team?
Sarah: Yeah, I'll talk to them. But I'm not sure if they've started yet.
Mike: That could be a blocker. We should have a backup plan.
John: Agreed. Let's also discuss the customer feedback we got last week.
Sarah: Right, customers are asking for dark mode. That's a high priority feature.
Mike: I can take that on. Should be done in 2 weeks.
John: Great! Any other concerns?
Sarah: The analytics dashboard is still pending. We need to get that done.
Mike: I think we can push that to next quarter. Current priorities are more important.
John: Okay, sounds good. Let's meet again next week to check progress.
